% 
% Function to detect onset of speech production in an audio recording.
% Input samples can be from a whole recording or from individual frames.
%
% INPUTS        samples                 vector of recorded samples
%               Fs                      sampling frequency of samples
%               onDur                   how long the intensity must exceed the
%                                       threshold to be considered an onset (ms)
%               onThresh                onset threshold
%               minVoiceOnsetTime       time (s) before which voice onset
%                                       cannot be detected (due to
%                                       anticipation errors, throat
%                                       clearing etc) - often set to .09 at
%                                       beginning of recording/first frame
%
% OUTPUTS       voiceOnsetDetected      0 = not detected, 1 = detected
%               voiceOnsetTime          time (s) when voice onset occurred
